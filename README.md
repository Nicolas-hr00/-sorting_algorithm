Insertion Sort: The insertion sort algorithm begins by assumin gthat the first elment of the array is already sorted. Then, it will iterate through the unsorted portion of the array comparing each element to the sorted portion of the array. Inserting it into its correct position the process will continue until all elements in the array are sorted. 
 
Insertion sort is a versatile and efficient sorting algorithm that can be used in a variety of aplications. 
 
The time complexity as follow: 

-Worse case scenario: O(n^2)
 
-Average case scenario: O(n^2)

-Best-case scenearion: O(n)

Quick Sort: Quick sort has been described as a "divide and conquer" algorithm. It will split problems into smaller subproblems. Then, sorting these subproblems the algoritm will use two arrays to hold elements less than an greater than or they could be equal. These are arrays are broken up into sub arrays to be sorted and eventually reconstructed together to create the final sorted array 

The time complexity as follow:

-Worse case scenario: O(nlogn)

-Average case scenario: O(n^2)

-Best-case scenearion: O(nlogn)

Selection Sort: Selection sort is a simple and intuive sorting algorithm that works by selecting the mimimum element from the unsorted portion of an input arraay by swpping it with the first element in the unsorted portion. This process is repeted until the entire array is sorted. One of the main advantages of selection sort is its simplicity and easy implementation. The algorithm is easy to understanad and it only requires a few lines of code.

The time complexity as follow: 

-Worse case scenario: O(n^2)

-Average case scenario: O(n^2)

-Best-case scenearion:  O(n^2)
